# 🧪 Task Guide: Asma (QA & Documentation)

**Mission:** Break the app before the customer does.

## 🕵️ Phase 1: Testing Plan (Week 1)
1.  **Test Environment**:
    - If you have access, set up a Virtual Machine with Windows and one with Linux.
    - Ensure you can run Hassan's builds on both.
2.  **Arabic Verification**:
    - Create a patient with a very long Arabic name.
    - Ensure it doesn't "Cut off" or align to the Left (It should be Right).

## 📚 Phase 2: User Manuals (Week 2)
1.  **Write the Guide**:
    - Create `docs/USER_MANUAL.pdf` (or .md).
    - Chapter 1: "How to Add a Patient".
    - Chapter 2: "How to Print a Ticket".
2.  **Stress Test**:
    - Click the "Add Patient" button 50 times very fast. Does the app freeze? Report to Bassam/Wissam if it does.

## 🔐 Phase 4: Security Test (Week 4)
1.  **Penetration Test**:
    - Try to steal the `healthcenter.db` file and open it in a generic SQLite Viewer.
    - If Hassan did his job, it should require a password. If it opens freely, **FAIL the ticket**.
2.  **Data Integrity**:
    - Unplug the computer while saving a patient. Restart. Is the data corrupted?

## 🏁 Phase 5: Final Acceptance (Week 5)
1.  **Clean Install**:
    - Take a computer that has NEVER had the app.
    - Run Ahmed's `setup.exe`.
    - Does it launch? Does it ask for the License Key?
2.  **Golden Master**:
    - Verify that version `1.0` has NO "Critical" bugs.
    - Give the "Green Light" for sale.
