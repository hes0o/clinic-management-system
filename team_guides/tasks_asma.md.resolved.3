# 🧪 Task Guide: Asma (QA) - Phase 1 Specs

**Mission:** Verify the Foundation.

## 1. Setup Verification
Run the following checks once the team delivers their parts:

*   **Launch Test**: Does the `.exe` (or `dotnet run`) launch without crashing?
*   **File Structure Test**: Does the project folder match Hassan's specified Vertical Slice structure?

## 2. Localization (RTL) Checks
Open Wissam's "Add Patient" form and perform these checks:
*   [ ] When typing in English, text aligns Left.
*   [ ] When typing in Arabic, text aligns Right (Correct behavior for Arabic UI).
*   [ ] The "Label" (e.g., "Name:") is to the **Right** of the input box, not the Left.

## 3. Data Persistence Check
*   Ask Bassam to enable his "Auto-Create DB" logic.
*   Delete the `healthcenter.db` file from `%AppData%`.
*   Run the app.
*   **Check**: Did the file reappear? (It should conform to Bassam's spec).

## 4. Reporting
*   If any of the above fail, reject the task in the project management board.
*   Attach a screenshot for any Visual Bug (Merve's area).
